        <p>This band is amazing! Ever since the first "Hey! Listen!" I was hooked.
            I think the new single "Ganondorf who?" was a real hit record!</p>

        <p>The band is truly amazing. After going through all of the drama they had, being able to keep playing like nothing happened is a god-given gift.</p>

        <p>They saved me from a normal, boring life. I used to be a plummer, then after listening to their music i decided to start saving princesses from castles insead. I have'nt looked back since.</p>
